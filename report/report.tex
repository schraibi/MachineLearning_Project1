\begin{abstract}
In this report we summarize our activities and results done for Project I. We replaced the missing values adequately, processed the features and tried several regression and classification methods. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Data Description}
Our data set (y, X) consists of 25'000 records. Each one of the input variable X is initially of dimensionality 30. y is a binary value (whether it is a Higgs Boson or not). Out of the 30 features only one is discrete and can take 4 different values. Some features have a lot of missing values (-999).

\section{Data visualization and cleaning}
We replaced the missing values accross the different features in the following way : We learn the distribution of each feature from the non-missing values (computing min, max, mean and variance) and then we randomly assign values according to this distribution to the missing values.
